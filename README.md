# Euler

Euler is a command-line utility thoughtfully designed to simplify the process of solving Project Euler challenges using Python.
This versatile tool is centered around four primary functions:

1. **Problem Retrieval**: Conveniently fetch problems, associated files, and images from Project Euler for local reference.
2. **Code Generation**: Generate basic Python template files (with potential support for additional languages in the future).
3. **Solution Validation**: Verify the correctness of your solutions to Project Euler problems, ensuring that you're on the right track.
4. **Utility Functions**: Access a range of utility functions that can aid you in tackling complex problems more effectively.
